                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Graduating Cairo University Faculty of Engineering Majoring in Structural Design. After working in
                    the
                    construction industry for a couple of years I found out that this field is not for me. I always had
                    passion for technology so i started self learning the basics of computer science and programming
                    fundamentals. First I landed an application support role in the data engineering field. I supported
                    offshore clients with Informatica Power center ETL tool. After gaining some experience i joined a
                    Major
                    bank in Egypt. I started supporting SAP BO reporting tool. Working with applications gave me
                    experience
                    working with servers and dataases as the work required knowledge of servers, databases and some
                    networking. I continue self-learning software development outside my working hour hoping one day i
                    can
                    land a role as a software developer</p>

                <h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>My goal is not easy but it is doable. First i hope in landing a software developer job working with
                    offshore company while being remote in Egypt. At the side i want to work as a freelancer. As for my
                    personal passion and i will be working on on the long run on building my own SaaS project.</p>

                <p>As of now I am working my app academy open bootcamp. I still have a long way to go. After finishing
                    it i
                    plan to try to finish full stack open and the odin project. Beside working on those three I plan to
                    start stengthening my DSA skills and start small on hackerank or leetcode but this will start after
